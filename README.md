# BlueSCSI tools for the Commodore Amiga.

Currently there are 2 utilities for managing the BlueSCSI V2 SCSI emulator in a Commodore Amiga.
For more information on BlueSCSI please see https://github.com/BlueSCSI/BlueSCSI-v2

You can select the device/unit from the properties of the icon.  Optionally you can specify these on the command line.

## CD Changer
The CD Changer allows you to swap between CD ISO images on your SD card on the fly.

## SD Transfer
The SD Transfer tool allows you to transfer files from the SD card to the Amiga.

**Known Issues**
* Currently on my Amiga 4000 with a cyberscsi device the SD Transfer utility will crash the scsi stack if the chosen device is not a CDROM!
* Need better icons
